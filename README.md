Kaggle competition Optiver - Trading at the Close
In this contest, I am tasked with creating a model that predicts the closing price fluctuations of numerous Nasdaq-listed stocks, drawing on data from the stock's order book and closing auction. Insights from the auction can help refine pricing, evaluate supply-demand balances, and pinpoint potential trading avenues.
## Long description
Stock exchanges operate under immense pressure, particularly during the final ten minutes when volatility soars. Every day, the Nasdaq Closing Cross auction sets the official closing prices for its listed securitiesâ€”vital information for the financial community.

Optiver, a premier global electronic market maker, thrives in this environment. With advanced technology, they engage in global trades spanning a range of financial instruments. As trading concludes on Nasdaq, entities like Optiver integrate order book and auction data, essential for determining the best prices.

In this competition, participants are tasked with developing a predictive model for the closing prices of numerous Nasdaq stocks using both order book and auction data. This model holds the potential to bolster market efficiency, especially during the high-stress concluding moments of trade. Engaging in this challenge offers an experience mirroring the roles at Optiver.
